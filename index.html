                            above a joint of roast beef, ‘would be doing the world at large a favour!’ It was a careless

                            For more than two hundred years, the Owens women have been blamed for everything that has
                            gone wrong in their Massachusetts town. Gillian and Sally have endured that fate as well: as
                            children, the sisters were forever outsiders, taunted, talked about, pointed at. Their
                            elderly aunts almost seemed to encourage the whispers of witchery, with their musty house
                            and their exotic concoctions and their crowd of black cats. But all Gillian and Sally wanted
                            was to escape.
                            One will do so by marrying, the other by running away. But the bonds they share will bring

                            Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and
                            his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words
                            because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray
                            that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the
                            other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the years
                            before, when she lived and made love with her husband, Luke; when she played with and
                            protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But
                            all of that is gone now . . .

                            Funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing, The Handmaid's Tale is at once
                            scathing satire, dire warning, and tour de force.

                            Under the endless skies of Botswana, there is always something Mma Ramotswe can do to help
                            someone and here she finds herself assisting a woman looking for her family. The problem is
                            the woman doesn't know her real name or whether any of her family members are still alive.
                            Meanwhile, Mma Makutsi is the recipient of a beautiful new bed that causes more than a few
                            sleepless nights. And, at Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni has come under

                            Considered to be one of Agatha Christie's most controversial mysteries, The Murder of Roger
                            Ackroyd breaks all the rules of traditional mystery writing.

                            The peaceful English village of King’s Abbot is stunned. First, the attractive widow Ferrars
                            dies from an overdose of veronal. Not twenty-four hours later, Roger Ackroyd—the man she had
                            planned to marry—is murdered. It is a baffling, complex case involving blackmail, suicide,
                            and violent death, a cast that taxes Hercule Poirot’s “little grey cells” before he reaches
                            one of the most startling conclusions of his fabled career

                            When the van door slammed on Offred's future at the end of The Handmaid's Tale, readers had
                            no way of telling what lay ahead for her--freedom, prison or death.

                            With The Testaments, the wait is over.

                            Margaret Atwood's sequel picks up the story more than fifteen years after Offred stepped
                            into the unknown, with the explosive testaments of three female narrators from Gilead.

                            In this brilliant sequel to The Handmaid's Tale, acclaimed author Margaret Atwood answers
                            the questions that have tantalized readers for decades.

                            "Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the
                            inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've
                            been living in." --Margaret Atwood

                            courage and love to survive, from the New York Times bestselling author of The Dovekeepers

                            known for its silver roses; from a school in a mountaintop village where three thousand Jews
                            were saved. Meanwhile, Ettie is in hiding, waiting to become the fighter she’s destined to
                            be.

                            What does it mean to lose your mother? How much can one person sacrifice for love? In a
                            world where evil can be found at every turn, we meet remarkable characters that take us on a
                            stunning journey of loss and resistance, the fantastical and the mortal, in a place where
                            all roads lead past the Angel of Death and love is never ending.

            <p>When the van door slammed on Offred's future at the end of The Handmaid's Tale, readers had no way of
                telling what lay ahead for her--freedom, prison or death.

                With The Testaments, the wait is over.
                Margaret Atwood's sequel picks up the story more than fifteen years after Offred stepped into the
                unknown, with the explosive testaments of three female narrators from Gilead.

                In this brilliant sequel to The Handmaid's Tale, acclaimed author Margaret Atwood answers the questions
                that have tantalized readers for decades.

                "Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration
                for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in."
                --Margaret Atwood

                An alternate cover edition of ISBN 978-0385543781 can be found here. (less)

            </p>
            <p>
                Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the years before, when she lived and made love with her husband, Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now . . .
                
                Funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing, The Handmaid's Tale is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and tour de force.
