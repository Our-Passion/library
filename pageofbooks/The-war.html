            The War of the Worlds chronicles the events of a Martian invasion as experienced by an unidentified male
            narrator and his brother. The story begins a few years before the invasion. During the astronomical
            opposition of 1894, when Mars is closer to Earth than usual, several observatories spot flashes of light on
            the surface of Mars. The narrator witnesses one of these flashes through a telescope at an observatory in
            Ottershaw, Surrey, England. He immediately alerts his companion, Ogilvy, “the well-known astronomer.” Ogilvy
            quickly dismisses the idea that the flashes are an indication of life on Mars. He assures the narrator that
            “[t]he chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to one.” The flashes continue unexplained for
            several nights.
