                    <h1>The World That We Knew</h1>
                    <h2> Author Name:Alice Hoffman  </h2>
                    <p>
                        In 1941, during humanity’s darkest hour, three unforgettable young women must act with courage and love
                to survive, from the New York Times bestselling author of The Dovekeepers and The Marriage of Opposites
                Alice Hoffman.

                In Berlin, at the time when the world changed, Hanni Kohn knows she must send her twelve-year-old
                daughter away to save her from the Nazi regime. She finds her way to a renowned rabbi, but it’s his
                daughter, Ettie, who offers hope of salvation when she creates a mystical Jewish creature, a rare and
                unusual golem, who is sworn to protect Lea. Once Ava is brought to life, she and Lea and Ettie become
                eternally entwined, their paths fated to cross, their fortunes linked.

                Lea and Ava travel from Paris, where Lea meets her soulmate, to a convent in western France known for
                its silver roses; from a school in a mountaintop village where three thousand Jews were saved.
                Meanwhile, Ettie is in hiding, waiting to become the fighter she’s destined to be.

                <!-- What does it mean to lose your mother? How much can one person sacrifice for love? In a world where evil
                can be found at every turn, we meet remarkable characters that take us on a stunning journey of loss and
                resistance, the fantastical and the mortal, in a place where all roads lead past the Angel of Death and
                love is never ending. -->
